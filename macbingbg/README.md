requires: py27-pyobjc-cocoa (Everything else should be installed by default).
If you value your sanity this means macports.
Only tested on 10.10 (Yosemite).

You may need to change the path to python (2.7) in the script (currently points to macports location)

It's up to you to wrangle it to launch at an appropriate time. I used crontab.
